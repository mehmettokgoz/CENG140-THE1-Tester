## CENG140, THE1 TESTER

This Python 3 tester code controls both first and second part of THE1 of CENG140 course.

## Usage

Put the docs tester.py and in and out folders at the same directions with your .c files.
Then run "python tester.py" command on the terminal.

If your code passes the case it only reports that it passed, but if it fails, it prints correct output and your output at the terminal.

NOTE: IF you have more in/out example, please send me and I would like to add them too.
